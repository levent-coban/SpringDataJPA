/*
 * @SpringBootApplication is a convenience annotation that adds all of the following:
 *
 * - @Configuration: Tags the class as a source of bean definitions for the application context.
 *
 * - @EnableAutoConfiguration: Tells Spring Boot to start adding beans based on classpath settings, other beans,
 *   and various property settings. For example, if spring-webmvc is on the classpath, this annotation flags the
 *   application as a web application and activates key behaviors, such as setting up a DispatcherServlet.
 *
 * - @ComponentScan: Tells Spring to look for other components, configurations, and services in the com/example package,
 *   letting it find the controllers.
 *
 *
 * The main() method uses Spring Bootâ€™s SpringApplication.run() method to launch an application.
 * Notice that there was not a single line of XML? There is no web.xml file, either.
 * This web application is 100% pure Java and we did not have to deal with configuring any plumbing or infrastructure.

/*
 * The Application class includes a demo() method that puts the CustomerRepository through a few tests.
 * First, it fetches the CustomerRepository from the Spring application context.
 * Then it saves a handful of Customer objects, demonstrating the save() method and setting up some data to work with.
 * Next, it calls findAll() to fetch all Customer objects from the database.
 * Then it calls findById() to fetch a single Customer by its ID.
 * Finally, it calls findByLastName() to find all customers whose last name is "Bauer".
 * The demo() method returns a CommandLineRunner bean that automatically runs the code when the application launches.
 *
 *
 * By default, Spring Boot enables JPA repository support and looks in the package (and its subpackages)
 * where @SpringBootApplication is located. If your configuration has JPA repository interface definitions
 * located in a package that is not visible, you can point out alternate packages by using @EnableJpaRepositories
 * and its type-safe basePackageClasses=MyRepository.class parameter.
